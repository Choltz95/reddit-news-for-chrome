# Reddit-News-for-Chrome
![alt text](header.jpg "header")

This extension parses reddit rss and json to provide a feed of the top ten articles posted on a user defined subreddit. Right now, the code is in pretty poor shape. I am working on refactoring the structure and adding features. I would definitely appreciate any bug notifications or feature requests. Check out the todo.txt to see what I am currently working on. Development will probably slow down after I return to school in September.
## Installation
Stable version on chrome webstore: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/reddit-news/pbhecjpnbjokeahpnaifpbjihffikbpd.

To use the version currently in development, clone the repo and visit chrome://extensions in your browser. Ensure that the *Developer mode* checkbox in the right-hand corner is checked and click *Load unpacked extension* to navigate to the repo.

Options currently exist to set the feed to one of a few different options (Custom subreddits will come with the next update), changing the number of displayed posts, the update timer, whether or not links open in the current tab, and whether or not upvotes are displayed.
