# ${1:Reddit-News-for-Chrome}
fork of Adam Albrights Hacker-News-For-Chrome. This extension parses reddit rss providing a feed of the top ten articles posted on a subreddit.
## Installation
Until there is a version hosted on the chrome webstore, clone the repo and visit chrome://extensions in your browser. Ensure that the * Developer mode * checkbox in the right-hand corner is checked and click * Load unpacked extension * to navigate to the repo.

## Credits
Adam Albright for his work on Hacker-News-For-Chrome, which I used as a foundation for this project.
